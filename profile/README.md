We've been protecting children for over 100 years - doing everything we can to prevent abuse and neglect, and giving expert support to help children recover. 
When our charity was founded all those years ago, it was for a clear and simple purpose - to stop abuse, keep children safe and give them the best possible 
start in life. Because childhood shapes who we become, and abuse never should. Today, we're still fighting for every childhood, and we won't stop until 
child abuse stops.
